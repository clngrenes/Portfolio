        Design together, wherever you are. AIDEA lets distributed teams co-create on the same canvas with zero friction. One designer can block out structure while another experiments with lighting, landscaping, or interior elements â€” every stroke appears instantly for both people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the hood, session handoff keeps edits conflict-free, version history lets you rewind if a direction doesn&apos;t land, and shared palettes ensure the team is always working with the same visual language. Whether it&apos;s a quick client jam or an all-day studio sprint, everyone stays aligned without screen-sharing fatigue.
