        AIDEA is designed for everyone who has ideas but struggles to bring them to life visually. Whether you&apos;re a student brainstorming for a presentation, a professional sketching out concepts in meetings, or someone who simply wants to explore their creativity â€“ AIDEA makes visual thinking accessible to all. You don&apos;t need to be an artist; you just need to have ideas worth sharing.
